1. JVM (Java Virtual Mschine)
    It provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
    It is a set of software tools and libraries + other files which are used for developing and it provides the runtime environment.

3. JDK (Java Development Kit)
    It helps us to develop Java applications, it contains JRE + development tools.

JVM, JRE and JDK are platform-dependent because the configuration of each OS is different however Java is platform-independent.
